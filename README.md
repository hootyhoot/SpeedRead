# SpeedRead
A very basic Speed Reading Java app built on Apache PDFBox and Apache Maven.

To run open the directory on your terminal and cd into the target folder. Then run "java -cp SpeedRead-release-jar-with-dependencies.jar mikhail.codes.Main".
If all else fails, install Maven and rebuild by going into main SpeedRead directory by cd in terminal and type "mvn package" to create a .jar executable in
the target folder.
